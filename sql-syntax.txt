## start out with a er diagram that indicates how the Entity Ralates to other things
## start by starting with the entities that we care about to a t
## do not USE: name, order, or rank as a colomn name
## A calculated/computed(C/C) colmn is made to make it where it calculates he value on its own if the expression is the same for every row
## C/C colomn can cause longer time and impact informance
## not persistent mean that i take the hit on the select, persistent means that i take no hit querying
## C/C is limitted to a SINGLE ROW
## Identity is the numerical value that is incremented per row
